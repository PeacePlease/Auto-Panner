 Basic understanding

****************************

1. Take FT of mono sample
2. Apply opposite ramp multiplication to each side (parameters of ramp to configure effect)
 a) Extreme case: ramp goes 1-0/0-1, with the zero/one at the highest/lowest frequency element of the signal
 b) Parameters: 
   i)    Lowest frequency to take into account/Highest to ignore <-- TODO
   ii)   Lowest/Highest amplification (average to be 1?), i.e. the gradient of the ramp
   iii)  Shape of the ramp (linear, exponential,...,)
   iv)   Direction (high to left, low to right, or vice versa
 c) Maybe we want to select frequency ranges and move them about the soundscape, i.e. non-ramp - possibly more esoteric. 
 d) Maybe we want to select specific voices to avoid murdering innocent acoustic instruments - possibly less esoteric (but way harder)
3. IFT each side



Effectively:
           ___________
__________/

         / \
 lowest f   highest f to 
to 'ignore'      'ignore'
